= JBoss BPM Suite & JBoss Fuse Integration Demo

Demo based on JBoss BPM Suite and JBoss Fuse products to highlight a few of the more common use cases.

  * call a BPM process from a fuse camel route.

There are two options available to you for using this demo; local and Docker.


== Option 1 - Local Install

=== Download and Install

. Clone this project to local workstation:
+
-----
git clone https://github.com/jbride/brms-fuse-integration-demo.git
-----
+
[NOTE]
If running on Windows, it is recommended the project be extracted to a location near the root drive path due to limitations of length of file/path names.
+
Once cloned, a new directory called `brms-fuse-integration-demo` should appear in your local filesystem.
For the purposes of this tutorial, this directory will be referred to as `$PROJECT_HOME` .

. Download the following from the JBoss Customer Portal
* JBoss EAP (jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip)
* BPM Suite (jboss-bpms-installer-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1.jar)
* Fuse (jboss-fuse-full-6.1.0.redhat-379.zip)
. Move downloads to $PROJECT_HOME/installs directory
. Ensure all files are executable:
.. cd $PROJECT_HOME
.. Execute:  `chmod -R 755 installs`
. Execute:  init script

.. `./init.sh`

=== Deploy BPM *customer-evaluation* project
. Start the JBoss BPM Suite server
.. cd  $PROJECT_HOME/target/jboss-eap-6.4
.. execute:  ./bin/standalone.sh
. log into the `BPM Console` at `http://localhost:8080/business-central`
+
Use the following credentials to authenticate:  (u:bpmsAdmin/p:bpmsuite1!).
. build and deploy the `customer-evaluation` project

=== Execute `simpleRoute` project
In this section, the camel based `simpleRoute` project will be executed at the command line.

Within the camel route, the class `com.jboss.examples.RestClientSimple` will be invoked.
This class utilizes Apache HTTP commons libraries to invoke the RESTFul API of the remote BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.
A single of the `customer.evaluation` BPMN2 process is started.

. cd $PROJECT_HOME/projects/brms-fuse-integration
. mvn camel:run

=== JBoss Fuse
. Add fabric server passwords for Maven Plugin to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file
+
Required so that the maven plugin can login to the fabric.
+
-----
     ```
     <!-- Server login to upload to fabric. -->
     <servers>
         <server>
             <id>fabric8.upload.repo</id>
             <username>admin</username>
             <password>admin</password>
         </server>
     </servers>
     ```
-----

. Start Fuse Server
.. cd target/jboss-fuse-6.1.1.redhat-412/
.. ./bin/fuse
. Create a new Fuse fabric (which consists of a single Fabric Server, by default). Enter the following command in the JBoss Fuse container console:
+
-----
fabric:create --wait-for-provisioning
-----
. Deploy `simpleRoute` project
.. cd projects/brms-fuse-integration/simpleRoute:
.. execute:
+
-----
mvn fabric8:deploy
-----

8. Login to Fuse management console at:  http://localhost:8181    (u:admin/p:admin).

9. Connect to root container with login presented by console  (u:admin/p:admin)

10. Create container name c1 and add bpmsuitefuse profile (see screenshot below)

11. Trigger camel route by placing support/data/message.xml files into target/jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-379/instances/c1/src/data folder (see screenshot below)

12. Enjoy the demo!


== Option2: docker install

The following steps can be used to configure and run the demo in a docker container

1. [Download and unzip.](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/brms-fuse-integration-demo/archive/master.zip).

2. Add products to installs directory.

3. Copy contents of support/docker directory to the project root.

4. Build demo image

	```
	docker build -t jbossdemocentral/brms-fuse-integration-demo .
	```

5. Start demo container

	```
	docker run --it -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 -p 8181:8181 jbossdemocentral/brms-fuse-integration-demo
	```

6. Login, build and deploy JBoss BPM Suite process project at http://<DOCKER_HOST>:8080/business-central (u:erics/p:bpmsuite1!).

7. Login to Fuse management console at:  http://<DOCKER_HOST>:8181    (u:admin/p:admin).

8. Navigate to Terminal tab and create fabric

     ```
     fabric:create --wait-for-provisioning
     ```

9. Within the running container, deploy simple route from /opt/jboss/projects/brms-fuse-integration/simpleRoute:

     ```
     mvn fabric8:deploy
     ```

	1. When prompted to update the settings.xml file, select **y** and enter admin/admin for the user name and password
	2. If the deployment fails due to "Access Denied", rerun command. This is a known [issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues/1404)

10. Create container name c1 and add bpmsuitefuse profile (see screenshot below)

11. Trigger camel route by placing /opt/jboss/support/data/message.xml file into /opt/jboss/fuse/jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-379/instances/c1/src/data folder (see screenshot below)

12. Enjoy the demo!
